PROJECT TITLE:P3M
PURPOSE OF PROJECT:Final Summative Game
VERSION or DATE:1/25/2022
AUTHOR:Joseph Cho

Sorting and recursion code is used to sort an ArrayList to present a list of high scores to the user.
This can be found at the bottom of Utilities in the form of quicksort which is later used in 
the HighScores class at lines 25, 48, and 57.

There is a cheat/debug code found in line 85 of the Player class. The code here allows the user to 
press the 'w' key to win the game as many times as they wish. The original function of this cheat
was to test the HighScores class. (Using this to win may not accurately record the high score if the
button is held down as it creates too many results)
